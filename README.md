# Bandcamp

This is a gem that wraps the Bandcamp API in a warm Rubyish hug.
To use it you will need to request an API key from them. For details see
[http://bandcamp.com/developer#key_request][].

# Usage

In your Gemfile
```ruby
gem install bandcampr
```

## Getting started:
```ruby
require 'bandcampr'
Bandcamp.config.api_key = "your_api_key"
```

## Search

Search the Bandcamp.com API by band name:
```ruby
matching_bands = Bandcamp.search "pitch black"
=> [#<Bandcamp::Band:0x00000001efa168>, #<Bandcamp::Band:0x00000001e53278>, ...]
```

## Resolving URLs

Bandcamp lets you resolve a given url to given band, track or album:

```ruby
sea_oleena = Bandcamp.resolve.url "seaoleena.bandcamp.com"
=> #<Bandcamp::Band:0x00000001ef20f8>

emoxygen_by_sun_monx = Bandcamp.resolve.url "http://interchill.bandcamp.com/track/emoxygen"
```

## Getting stuff

A specific track:
```ruby
evolution_11 = Bandcamp.get.track 1735088360
=> #<Bandcamp::Track:0x0000000162c7e8>
```

Many specific tracks:
```ruby
tracks = Bandcamp.get.tracks 1735088360, 1739611553
=> [#<Bandcamp::Track:0x00000001316ab8>, #<Bandcamp::Track:0x00000001314a10>, ...]
```

A band:
```ruby
pitchblack = Bandcamp.get.band 950934886
=> #<Bandcamp::Band:0x000000017d43e8>
```

An album:
```ruby
ape_to_angel = Bandcamp.get.album 2909726980
=> #<Bandcamp::Album:0x00000001e20c60>
```

Bands, Albums and Tracks all have a #to_json method that does what you would
expect a to_json method to do.

## TODO list

* A nice interface for requesting discographies.
* Rails 3 integration so you can use these ojects with partials and form_for.
* Duck typing helpers along the lines of [ActiveSupport's
  #acts_like?](http://apidock.com/rails/Object/acts_like%3F)
